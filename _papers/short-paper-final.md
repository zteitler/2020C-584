In this assignment you will turn in the **final version** of your short paper.

As a reminder, from the syllabus, this paper is:
> A short paper about an open question, unsolved problem, or currently studied research
  area within algebra, algebraic geometry, or computational algebra, or an application
  of one of those areas.

You should already have a topic chosen, already identified one or more sources,
and already written a first draft.
Now it's time to finish it!


## Assignment

In this assignment, write the final version of your short paper.
+ Include a bibliography. See [How To Bibliography]({{ "/assets/how-to-bibliography.pdf" | relative_url }}) (pdf).
  (You might only have one or two sources.
  That's okay.
  Part of the purpose is to learn how to write a bibliography.)
+ Be aware of your audience. Typically you should write to an audience of your peers,
  i.e., graduate students still learning algebra and algebraic geometry.



## Formatting

+ Please write your responses in a PDF file created using LaTeX.
+ Make it have a filename like `584-ShortPaper-FinalVersion-YourLastName.pdf`,
  for example `584-ShortPaper-FinalVersion-Teitler.pdf` (but with *your* name, not mine).
+ Upload the PDF to BlackBoard.
+ For legibility, use the `[12pt]` option (as in `\documentclass[12pt]{amsart}`).
+ For legibility and marking, use `\linespread{2.4}` (double spacing).
