  or computational algebra, or an application of one of those areas
  (but emphasizing the algebraic aspect).


## Assignment

In this assignment please look at some books and papers
(recommended sources are listed in the course syllabus)
in order to identify a topic for your term paper.
You will write 0.5-2 pages to describe the *main topic*
of your term paper, and address at least some of the following questions:
+ What will your paper be about?
+ Why is it an interesting topic? Why are you interested in it?
  (How will you make it interesting for the reader?)
+ What will be the "main takeaway" or main point of your paper?
  What parts and technical details will you skip over, to get to the main point?
+ What one or more high-quality sources will you use for your paper?

## Formatting

+ Please write your responses in a PDF file created using LaTeX.
+ Make it have a filename like `584-TermPaper-Topic-YourLastName.pdf`,
  for example `584-TermPaper-Topic-Teitler.pdf` (but with *your* name, not mine).
+ Upload the PDF to BlackBoard.
