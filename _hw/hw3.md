<!--  -->
Please remember to include your name and the homework number
(this is Homework 3) within the document.
Some additional formatting instructions
are in the syllabus.
To summarize:

* Turn in your homework as a PDF with a filename like
  `584-Homework-<number>-<your last name>.pdf`,
  e.g.,
  `584-Homework-03-Smith.pdf`
* Use a new page (`\newpage`) for each problem
* State which question you are answering and the actual question.
  Then, start your answer in a new paragraph
* Use environments such as `proof` and `theorem`
  (via `\begin{proof}`...`\end{proof}`)
* Use 12pt option `\documentclass[12pt]{amsart}`
  and `\linespread{2.4}`.

Please find and use the LaTeX template uploaded to BlackBoard and/or
course website.

This homework involves exercises from the Hassett textbook.
1. 2.3 or 2.4 (page 29)
2. 2.6 or 2.7
3. One of 2.9 or 2.10


(I hope that you will at least think a little about all of these problems and solve
as many as possible. Turn in the best and/or most interesting ones you are able to solve.)

You are encouraged to work together on the homework!
